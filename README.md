This repo contains a series of visual experiments built with JavaScript that explore the topic of __diffusion-limited aggregation__ (DLA) as a method for generating interesting 2D forms.

I am particularly interested in the application of such techniques in the context of digital fabrication, so these experiments will be more focused on schematic representations (colorless, vector-based, SVG/STL exports) over purely visual effects.

## About diffusion-limited aggregation

_Diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA)_  is a process in which randomly-moving particles clump together (_aggregate_) over time to form long, fractal, branch-like chains. It closely models the behavior of molecules that have an affinity for bonding to one another as they move (_diffuse_) through some medium (air, water, etc).
